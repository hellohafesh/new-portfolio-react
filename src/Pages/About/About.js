                Hello there

                This is All Hafesh. I develop front ends and the MERN stack. As a programmer, I constantly like discovering and learning more about new topics. My ability to pick things up quickly is a strength. This capacity for learning empowers me to take on new challenges each time I encounter them. I've been gradually enhancing my communication abilities and strategic thinking. I never lose sight of my task. Why am I doing this, what's the point, and will what I do make people's lives easier? I constantly ask myself such questions. I also enjoy technology. I hop over new technologies whenever they appear in order to learn more about them.
